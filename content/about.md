Graduated from University of Surrey. I'm interested in software development, mainly in areas as back-end, systems development, and parallel computing. I specialize in mainly in C & C++ followed by Java and Python. My experience also includes working with React, Vue.js, and Amazon Web Services. I am currently working for [Hindsight Software](https://www.hindsightsoftware.com/) on a back-end implementation of [Behave Pro plugin for Jira](https://www.hindsightsoftware.com/behave-pro). In the free time I am contributing to open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/matusnovak) and playing with a low level embedded hardware (Arduino, Atmel, Texas Instruments development boards).
