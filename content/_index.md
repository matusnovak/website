Hi, I am a software developer with a strong interest in backend enrgineering, cloud computing, low level code, and a little bit of a game development. I have graduated from [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) and I am currently employed as a software developer at [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/) working on [FlashBlade](https://www.purestorage.com/products/file-and-object/flashblade.html).

My skills include C++, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, including a little bit of OpenGL and Vulkan. In my free time I work on open source projects and play around with low level embeded hardware such as Arduino, ESP32, or STM32 microprocessors.
