## Doxybook2 

Doxygen XML to Markdown (or JSON) converter. Generate beautiful C++ documentation by converting Doxygen XML output into markdown pages via [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), or your custom generator. Comes with optional templating mechanism and extensive configuration file.

## Doxybook

This python tool will take an xml output generated by the Doxygen and converts that into markdown to be used by GitBook, Vuepress, Docsify, or MkDocs. This project has been replaced by Doxybook2.

## WrenBind17


WrenBind17 is a C++17 wrapper for [Wren programming language](http://wren.io/). This project was heavily inspired by [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and by [Wren++](https://github.com/Nelarius/wrenpp). This library is header only and does not need any compilation steps. Simply include the &lt;wrenbind17/wrenbind17.hpp&gt; header in your application and you are good to go!

## Raspberry Pi OpenGL without X

Run your OpenGL ES2 or ES3 application on Raspberry Pi without using an X server. Done using EGL Raspberry Pi 1-3 and KMS on Raspberry Pi 4. The example uses EGL to create a pixel buffer as a surface.

## Tiva C Series CMake example

This is an example project for [Tiva C Series TM4C1294 board](http://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C1294XL). This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to generate the build files and [OpenOCD](https://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd/) for connecting to the board's embedded debugger and enabling live debugging through Visual Studio Code.

## Raspberry Pi SSD1963 driver

This is a driver/library for TFT LCD SSD1963 (800x480) with OpenGL support. This library uses OpenGL ES 2 for render context and uses pure EGL without any X Server or virtual framebuffers. No special drivers or special ICs are needed, the LCD is driven by GPIO only.

## Arduino HGS2561281 OLED Driver

This library provides support for the HGS2561281 256x128 display which uses two SSD1322 chips to control two 256x64 OLED displays.
